                <p>
                    Built a multi-instance multi-label classifier that would predict the labels
                    describing the
                    business attributes of restaurants from the user submitted pictures. We have
                    built multiclass SVM as well as an ensemble
                    model consisting of a support vector machine, logistic regression, and
                    random forest using SIFT and pretrained CNNs like
                    AlexNet and VGG, to extract features. The data is taken from Kaggle and
                    consists of nearly 0.2 million pictures.

                </h6>
                <p>
                    Built an LSTM model for predicting the action that is being done in the
                    video. The features were extracted from a pretrained VGG network. The LSTM
                    was compared with SVM to analyze its
                    performance.

                    technique to extract features from objects and recognize them using OpenCV.
                    Used images of different cars and human beings to train the classifier.

                    Given any 2D/3D points as input, correlation coefficient and regression line
                    can be used for statistical interpretations. The input can be related to
                    population, stock markets etc. Used CUDA for parallelizing the code.
